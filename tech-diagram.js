         TECH STACK DIAGRAM

## **3. Single Tech Stack Diagram**

Below is a **single tech stack diagram** to visualize the architecture of your app:

### **Explanation of the Diagram**

1. **Frontend (Angular)**:
   - Provides the UI for users to interact with the app.
   - Communicates with the backend via REST APIs (e.g., for creating transactions).

2. **Backend (Node.js)**:
   - Acts as the middleware between the frontend and the blockchain/database.
   - Handles business logic, API requests, and database queries.

3. **Ethereum Blockchain**:
   - Smart contracts handle payment validation and transaction integrity.
   - Ganache is used for local blockchain testing.

4. **PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Stores user profiles, transaction metadata, and logs for scalability.

### **Best Practices**

1. **Code Coverage**:
   - Maintain at least 80% test coverage across all layers.
   - Automate coverage reporting in CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Developmental Setup**:
   - Use `.env` files for environment-specific configurations.
   - Automate database migrations and local blockchain setup.

3. **Tech Stack**:
   - Keep the architecture modular to facilitate future enhancements.
   - Use a layered approach for better separation of concerns.
